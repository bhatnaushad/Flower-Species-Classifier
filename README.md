The network predicts the species of the flowers.

The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/content.udacity-data.com/nd089/flower_data.tar.gz).

The model has been trained on Google Colab using [`densenet161`](https://pytorch.org/docs/0.3.0/torchvision/models.html) pretrained model with a custom classifier.
